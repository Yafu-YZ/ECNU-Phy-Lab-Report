# ECNU-Phy-Lab-Report
Due to our utter disdain for writing physics lab reports, we created this repo to graciously assist each other.

This repository is organized according to the school's experimental courses, with folders created in the format of Course Name-Number-Experiment Name. Word and LaTeX file formats are provided. Please note that this repository does not include experimental data or answers to the reflection questions.

We hope this repository will quickly improve your ability to write lab reports.”

# ECNU-物理实验报告
出于对书写物理实验报告的极度厌恶，我们创立了这个仓库来帮助大家。

本仓库根据学校实验课程进行分类，以*课程名-序号-实验名*创立文件夹。提供word，latex形式的文件，本仓库恕不提供实验数据，和思考题回答。

希望本仓库能快速提高你的实验报告书写。
